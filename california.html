<center><p> To start of California Adventure is better than Disneyland. If your my age (15) California adventure 
is a better choice to go to. California adventure first opened in 2001 and has made progress with rides and such 
over time. When it first opened it had not that many rides, it was originally a part of the parking lot but 
they decided to turn it into California Adventure. In 2007 is when work started to happen and came Toy 
Story Midway Mania, and by 2008 came the World of Color. The World of color is a night time water show, that
includes lights, fire, lasers, and fog. It is presented on the pixar pier. Originally for California adventures 
pier was called Paradise pier but now is called pixar pier with the new Incredicoaster. California adventure 
is like the little sister of Disneyland, it jumpy, it's fun, and its exciting. It keeps it family friendly but 
has more of a kick to it, it has thrill rides that are based off of more recent movies such as Incredibles 2,
Monster's Inc, Cars,and many more and you are able to purchase beer on the boardwalk. California adventure is just
gives more excitement. For example, my first time on the car ride was so much fun. It had my heart pumping 
and had my adrenalin going because I wanted to beat the other team.
