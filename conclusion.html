<center><p> Overall California Adventure is better than Disneyland. California Adventure has many 
qualities that are better than what Disneyland has to provide. I think, Disneyland is a great place
but I feel that California Adventure gives you a better experience. Although, it doesn't have
as many rides, the rides are better at California Adventure and makes you feel pumped and has your 
adrenaline going. As for Disneyland it's more mellow and easy going.  </p> </center>
