<center><p>  Disneyland is more of the bigger sister, it's a lot older, has rides that are based off of old movies such 
as Peter pan, Pirates of the Caribbean, Alice in wonderland, and many more and it's just more mellow. If you
wanted to be surrounded by little kids all over the place and strollers bumping into you, Disneyland is the way 
to go. Disneyland rides are more of sit down and look around such as the pirates of the Caribbean ride, you sit
in the boat and just look around at the little show that they give you. Another example is the jungle cruise and 
its a small world, you sit in the little boat, look at the show that they give and listen to the music they play.
Disneyland doesn't have that man thrill rides, I will say there are rides such as  space mountain, or splash mountain
that are pretty cool and are fun and give your excitement, but most rides are more mellow. I personally feel if 
you just want to roam around and have a chill experience you should go to Disneyland, but if you want things
to be more exciting and hyped up California Adventure is the way to go</p></center>
